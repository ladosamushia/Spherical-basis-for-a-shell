\section{Introduction}

Cosmological fields are often analyzed in Fourier basis. This is convenient
because the distribution of matter in the Universe is initially very close to
Gaussian with different Fourier modes statistically independent form each other.
Although, gravitational instability couples initially independent Fourier modes
on smaller scales, on large scales, where the gravitational evolution is close
to linear, the Fourier modes remain uncorrelated.

Fourier bases depends on the geometry of the analyzed volume. For a cube with a
side length $L$ and  periodic boundary conditions the proper set of complete
orthogonal basis vectors is made of exponentials 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Fcube}
f_{l,m,n}(x,y,z)\propto e^{i\frac{2\pi}{L}\left(lx + my + mz\right)},
\end{equation}

where $l$, $m$, $n$ are integers and $x$, $y$, $z$ are Cartesian coordinates.

Inside of a sphere of size $R$, with zero boundary conditions on the outer
boundary and a restriction that the functions are finite everywhere inside, the
complete orthogonal basis is

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:Fsphere}
f_{\ell,m,n}(r,\theta,\phi) \propto j_\ell\left(\frac{k_{\ell,n}} {R}r\right)Y^\ell_m
(\theta,\phi).
\end{equation}

Here $j_\ell$ are spherical Bessel functions of the first kind, $Y^\ell_m$ are the
spherical harmonics, and $k_{\ell,n}$ is the n-th zero of the $\ell$-th order
spherical Bessel function. $r$, $\theta$, $\phi$ are spherical coordinates,
while $n$, $\ell$ and $m$ are integers satisfying $\ell \leq m \leq \ell$.

Real survey volumes are neither cubes nor spheres, but rather have a complicated
geometry. A standard practice is to embedd these volumes into a larger cube,
zero-pad the areas outside the actual observable volume, and Fourier decompose the
field in the basis of Eq.~(\ref{eq:Fcube}). Alternatively, one can use an
enclosing sphere and the basis of Eq.~(\ref{eq:Fsphere}).

The Cartesian basis is more convenient to compute and interpret and
is more frequently used in the analysis of galaxy clustering data. The spherical
basis of has the advantage that some of the relevant physics (e.g. redshift-space
distortions, redshift evolution) is better aligned with the coordinates.

In both cases we are using a larger than observed volume for Fourier
decomposition which gives rise to so called ``Window effects''. The basis vectors
are not orthogonal anymore. Since the decomposition volume is larger than the
observed volume there are too many basis vectors and not all of them are
independent. This affects large scales (comparable to the size of the survey) more
and correlates those modes even when they are Gaussian. If we decomposed the
distribution in true eigenvectors of the observed volume large scale linear modes
would be uncorrelated. Unfortunately, this is not possible due to a complicated
nature of visibility masks.

In this paper we propose a mehtod that comes very close to this goal. The method
relies on the fact that surveys are usually analised in redshift slices with a
sharp boundary at $r_\mathrm{min}$ and $r_\mathrm{max}$ away from the observer,
forming a spherical shell. The \mathbf{exact} eigenvectors of a spherical shell
can be easily computed and expressed in terms of first and second kind spherical
Bessel functions. We can go one step further and enclose the observed angular mask
into a bounding spherical cap. We will show below that even the \mathbf{exact}
eigenvectors for a spherical cap can also be easily computed and expressed in
terms of Legendre functions of the first and second kind. This results in a new
basis for Fourier decomposition that is similar to the spherical basis but has
fewer (less correlated) modes. The basis can be described by $k_n$ - a wavenumber
of a radial mode, and two orbital numbers $\tilde{\ell}$ and $\tilde{m}$ that
describe angular patterns. Unlike spherical Fourier decomposition $\tilde{\ell}$
does not have to be an integer.

The basis we propose has a number of advantages, especially when describing
clustering on large scales. The radial modes are in fact exact and fully
uncorrelated. Since survey masks do not form a perfect spherical cap, the angular
modes are not exact but are closer to the ``true'' basis than the conventional
spherical harmonics decomposition. As a result the new basis has fewer
eigenvectors for the same range of scales that are much less correlated becaues of
the reduced redundancy.

The new basis is not computationally more expensive than the standard
decompositions and may be advantagous when analysing large-scale structure on
large (compared to the size of the sample) scales such as the analysis of
non-Gaussianity in galaxy and weak lensing surveys, $\ldots$.

We will derive the basis in section~\ref{sec:basis} and will apply it to the
large-scale clustering of BOSS DR12 galaxies in section~\ref{sec:data} to
demonstrate that it indeed reduces the correlation of large-scale modes.
